	abstract = {Auditory scene analysis (ASA) is the process by which the auditory system separates the individual sounds in natural-world situations, in which these sounds are usually interleaved and overlapped in time and their components interleaved and overlapped in frequency. ASA is difficult because the ear has access only to the single pressure wave that is the sum of the pressure waves coming from all the individual sound sources (such as human voices, or foot steps). To construct a separate mental description for each source, ASA must analyze the incoming signal by the use of heuristic processes. These are based on regularities in the incoming sound that result from the fact that it is really the sum of some underlying sounds. For example, the incoming sound is built up of many frequency components. If a set, A, of these frequency components begin together at exactly the same time, whereas another set, B, all begin together, but at a different time from those of A, then the components of A will be considered as parts of one sound, and those of B as parts of a different sound. This grouping is justified by a regularity in the environment, namely that all the frequency components of a single sound tend to start at the same time. Other heuristic analyses are based on different regularities in how sound is produced. The grouping of these components can determine the perceived pitch, timbre, loudness, and spatial position of the resulting sounds.},
