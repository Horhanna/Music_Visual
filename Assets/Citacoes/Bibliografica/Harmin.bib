	abstract = {This paper describes a tool designed for the analysis, retrieval, and visualization of harmonic progressions which aim to provide the user with valuable statistics and graphs. This output is intended to help the users to better understand the harmonic content of a music dataset, hopefully causing the emergence of interesting findings. The analysis of the music of Antônio Carlos Jobim motivated the creation of our tool, and for this reason is presented as our case study. We also describe how this tool can be integrated into an accompaniment system, going beyond analysis into the fields of interactive music and composition.},
