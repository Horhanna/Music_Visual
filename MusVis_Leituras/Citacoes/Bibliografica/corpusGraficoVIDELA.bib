	abstract = {This paper deals with the graphic music of León Schidlowsky (b.1931), a genre cultivated by the composer mostly from 1969 to 1984 after emigrating from Chile to Israel. It presents a general panorama of the development of the graphical language of the composer, and analyzes some specific features of his work Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen (1979), considered by the author of the article as a culminating point of Schidlowsky’s creative development. The research underlines the conception of this work as multimedia derived from the collage technique synthesizing the different musical, visual and performative aspects of the work into a simultaneous visualization of what amounts to be an essentially temporal art. Besides, the study explores the social and political contents of the work, to conclude that this heterogeneous and multifarious conception is a natural feature of a transcultural composer, who moves freely among diverse cultures and aesthetics.},
