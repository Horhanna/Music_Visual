	abstract = {We introduce MedleyDB: a dataset of annotated, royaltyfree multitrack recordings. The dataset was primarily developed to support research on melody extraction, addressing important shortcomings of existing collections. For each song we provide melody f0 annotations as well as instrument activations for evaluating automatic instrument recognition. The dataset is also useful for research on tasks that require access to the individual tracks of a song such as source separation and automatic mixing. In this paper we provide a detailed description of MedleyDB, including curation, annotation, and musical content. To gain insight into the new challenges presented by the dataset, we run a set of experiments using a state-of-the-art melody extraction algorithm and discuss the results. The dataset is shown to be considerably more challenging than the current test sets used in the MIREX evaluation campaign, thus opening new research avenues in melody extraction research.},

	abstract = {A music piece contains a large amount of information represented as a series of instructions corresponding to notes that must be played at speciﬁc times. These simple notes are combined to form complex harmonic structures that can be difﬁcult to identify and analyze. Due to its simplicity and straightforward interpretation, music sheets, and piano rolls have been the visual metaphor employed by most music visualization tools to support interpretation. Albeit it can represent all necessary elements to perform a music piece, these metaphors do not explicitly show many of the patterns and structures inherent to music arrangements, such as rhythm progression and harmonic interactions, needing users to create a mental model of them. Moreover, comparing different pieces and visualizing how a particular instrument track relates to the others is an issue not only for music sheet-based techniques but also for most existing music visualization methods. In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework, called Music Overview, Stability and Harmony Visualization (MoshViz), which facilitates the visualization and understanding of music renditions, focusing mainly on the visual analysis of speciﬁc musical instruments. Our approach creates a high-level model of music data and highlights structures of interest, enabling a detail+overview visualization to assist users in the task of identifying harmonic and melodic patterns. The usefulness and representativeness of MoshViz is conﬁrmed by a set of user tests which demonstrate that the proposed visual metaphor matches, with a high degree of accuracy, the mental model of different users regarding the recognizable patterns of sounds.},

	abstract = {Music expertise is the ability to understand the structural elements of music compositions by reading musical scores or simply listening to music performance. Although the most common way to learn music is through the study of musical scores, this approach is demanding in terms of learning ability, given the required implicit knowledge of music theoretical concepts. Learning musical rules is hard, especially for classical music. To simplify this task, visualization is one of the most promising approaches, also thanks to the human visual cognition ability (i.e., visual memory, visual attention, and so on).},
