	abstract = {The field of neuroscience has brought several contributions to numerous different areas, in order to achieve a better understanding of the human brain function. The study of music and how it affects people’s brains has been studied in conjunction with many other areas, such as music perception, movement, memory, language and music evoked emotions. Also, many articles have been pointing out to music as a rehabilitation tool in different neurological alterations, such as aphasia, autism and dyslexia. This article presents a review of representative studies published in the last decade about neuroscience and music, especially on the areas quoted above. In conclusion, one can perceive the possibilities of contributions from neuroscience to the field of music itself, as well as music pedagogy, music performance and music therapy.},
