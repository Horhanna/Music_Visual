abstract = {This paper describes the basic principles of traditional 2D hand drawn animation and
their application to 3D computer animation. After describing how these principles
evolved, the individual principles are detailed, addressing their meanings in 2D hand
drawn animation and their application to 3D computer animation. This should demonstrate
the importance of these principles to quality 3D computer animation.},
