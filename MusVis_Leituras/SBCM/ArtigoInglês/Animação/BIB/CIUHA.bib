abstract = {Visualizing music in a meaningful and intuitive way is a challenge. Our aim is to
visualize music by interconnecting similar aspects in music and in visual perception.
We focus on visualizing harmonic relationships between tones and colours. Related
existing visualizations map tones or keys into a discrete set of colours. As concurrent
(simultaneous) tones are not perceived as entirely separate, but also as a whole,
we present a novel method for visualizing a group of concurrent tones (limited to
the pitches of the 12-tone chromatic scale) with one colour for the whole group. The
basis for calculation of colour is the assignment of key spanning circle of thirds
to the colour wheel. The resulting colour is not limited to discrete set of colours:
similar tones, chords and keys have similar colour hue; dissonance and consonance
are represented by low and high colour saturation respectively. The proposed method
is demonstrated as part of our prototype music visualization system using extended
3-dimensional piano roll notation.},
